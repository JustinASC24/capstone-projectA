            <p>"First and foremost, I want to thank all the faculty and staff of All-Star Code and JPMC. It was through comprehensive technical lessons and the insightful core skills sessions
                that helped minimize and bridge my knowledge gaps and helped alleviate some of that initial friction and frustration. <br>
                <br>Although the program was only 3 weeks long, I was able to learn more than I could ask for, learning a variety of programming languages alongside the character it takes to become successful. Initially, 
                I was skeptical about the program, but immediately upon joining, I was met with a comfortable and inclusive environment, where instructors of the Digital Pioneers Cohort striked a perfect balance between work and fun. <br>(You can't forget about the Kahoots)"

        <div id = 'nasir_response_div'> 
            <p>"All Star Code is a program I never thought I would end up in.  Coding, programing, web development, are all things I haven't considered up until this point. Thanks to All Star Code, I am walking away with new experiences, skills, and knowledge.  That may or may not be of aid to me in the future. But all in all, I'm glad to have been accepted and to have experienced the Summer Intensive."

            <p>"I really enjoyed my time at All-Star Code, specifically what I've learned. In just as short as 3 weeks, I've gotten a general grasp of many programming languages and their fundamental principles ranging from HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even how they work alongside one another. <br><br> Apart from technical skills, I have learned more about effective collaboration, how to adopt a creative and critical thinking mindset, and ultimately learning and reaping the benefits of prioritizing outreach."
